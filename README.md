Find trending anime by analysing torrent downloads and wrap it all up in a webpage. The goal was to see what's popular this season so I have a list of potential shows to check out.

Sometime in 2016 the web scraping service I was using shut down so the code doesn't work end-to-end. I meant to update it but actually Crunchyroll does a reasonable job of trending anime (they just don't have all shows). For anything else, MyAnimeList.net started doing a trending popularity so there isn't much need for this tool anymore.

I'm archiving this code out here in case some components might be useful, such as forecasting torrent downloads. Maybe that's useful for other lightweight forecasting tasks where you know that it's always increasing, that you get diminishing increases, and that you want to fit to only like 3 data points at first.
